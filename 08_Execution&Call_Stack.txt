                     ---------------------JavaScript Execution Context---------------------------------

    In start of execution of JavaScript first global execution context are defined in this keyword.

1. Global Execution Context
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context


* Global Execution Context in two phase

1. Memory Creation Phase
2. Execution Phase



 ** Code Example

    let val1 = 10
    let val2 = 5

    Function addnum(num1, num2){
        let total = val1 + val2
        return total
    }

    let result1 = addnum(val1, val2);
    let result2 = addnum(10, 2);

 In Above Code Execution This way


 1. Global Execution

    this

 2. Memory Creation Phase                       3. Execution Phase

    val1 = undefined                              val1 = 10   
    val2 = undefined                              val2 = 5                              
    addnum = defination                           addnum = ------> in function execution crete new variable environment and execution context
    result1 = undefined                           result1 = 15                                1. Memory Creation Phase       2. Execution Phase          
    result2 = undefined                           addnum = ----> same process as Above            val1 = undefined             num1 = 10             
                                                  result2 = 12                                    val2 = undefined             num2 = 5      
                                                                                                  total = undefined            total = 15      
                                                                                                                |
                                                                                                                |------> After function execution Memory Creation
                                                                                                                         phase is deleted


-------------------------------- Call Stack-------------------------------------------------


in Call Stack is use for a LIFO method - last in first out
